# Prime Factorization in React using REST API

### Thank Yous

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Followed a React JS REST API Tutorial here:

Modified it to use another API, and have fewer extraneous functions.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
